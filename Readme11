sql:-

when u try to delete particular id then it cant be deleted directly if there is foreign key used in other table

so use "ON DELETE CASCADE" while using foreign key
eg:- FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
usage:- delete from customer where customer_id=1;
it will delete that customer_id from customer as well as order table
