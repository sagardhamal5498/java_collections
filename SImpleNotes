Little Things To Know Before Interview


1- In java constructors can never inherited but we can call from child class using super keyword.

2- Class variables - static variable declared in class referred as class variables.

3- Stack Memory - It stores program and and after execution it removes LIFO pattern.

4- Heap Memory - It stores objects and after execution it eligible for garbage  collection.

5-Local variables must have to initialized or else it gives runtime error.

6-Static Variables - Not mandatory to initialize static members and have global access.

7-Non static or instance variables - It belongs to object and not mandatory to initialize.

8-Reference Variables -  ref variables can store only null value and object address.

9-Constructor - 1-same name as that of class and called when object is created.
                2-constructor chaining can call  constructor  from another constructor.
                3-constructor can have more than one constructor in same differentiated based on type and no arguments.
                4-java does not support copy constructor.
                5-Constructors can't be inherited in Java because they are specific to the class they initialize,
                  and allowing inheritance would break encapsulation and the principle of each class defining its own object initialization.
                 Instead, a subclass can call a superclass's constructor using super().


10-This keyword - 1-Refers to current object execution.
                  2-Can call another constructor using this() and must be first statement in that constructor.
                  3-Can not used inside static context but can accCoess static members but should not be performed.


11-Super Keyword - 1-Can access parent class methods,constructors and variables.
                   2-Super keyword can't be used in static context.
